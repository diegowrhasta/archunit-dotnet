# ArchUnit .NET

Small project to prototype how different Arch Unit tests should be put together.

## Setup

We have simply installed [ArchUnitNet](https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnitNET). As the powering library for our architecture 
tests.

This repository aims at implementing architecture testing for different architecture patterns. All the analysis and extra 
notes can be found in this specific [github corner of the world](https://github.com/diegowrhasta/personal-adoc-notes/blob/main/unit-testing/arch-testing.adoc).
